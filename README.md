# Pagination Component

This is a simple and reusable pagination component built with React. It provides navigation for pages in a paginated list, displaying a set of page numbers along with “Previous” and “Next” arrows. The component handles the logic for rendering page numbers, handling page changes, and displaying ellipses (...) when there are more pages available.

## Features

- Displays page numbers with the option to skip to the first or last page
- Supports dynamic rendering of page numbers, showing a limited range of pages based on the current page
- Shows ellipses (...) when there are more pages to show before or after the visible range
- Highlights the current page with an active style
- Customizable through currentPage, totalPages, and a callback function for page changes.
